I would like to get back into doing this.  But I have some work ahead of me
I am out of practice and don't have an end goal yet.  So some thoughts on goals:

- Building static web pages and are nice to look at
- Static page that uses some sort of cloud function to accomplish a task
- to be filled in as I come up with some actual things I want to do...
